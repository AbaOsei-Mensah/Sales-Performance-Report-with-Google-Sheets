### Recommendations

- Focus marketing and inventory on the top 5 bestselling products: Caramel Stuffed Bars, Organic Choco Syrup, 70% Dark Bites, Eclairs, and Manuka Honey Choco, as these 
 generate the highest revenue per unit.

- Recognize and incentivize high-performing salespeople like Gigi Bohling, Ches Bonnell, Barr Faughny, and Ram Mahesh to maintain strong sales momentum in each country.

- Discontinue underperforming products in each market, such as Raspberry Choco and 99% Dark & Pure in the USA, White Choco in Australia, Almond Choco in Canada, and 70% 
  Dark Bites in New Zealand, to optimize product offerings.

- Regularly review country-specific sales data to tailor product portfolios and promotional strategies to local preferences and maximize profitability.

- Streamline reporting and feedback from sales teams to quickly identify trends, bestsellers, and products needing improvement or removal in each region.

### Limitations 

- Lack of Contextual Factors: The data does not account for factors like seasonality, promotions, regional trends, or external events that could temporarily affect sales 
 figures.

- Salesperson Influence: High-performing salespeople may skew product sales in certain regions, making it hard to tell if success is due to the product or the individual’s 
  efforts.
  
- Regional Differences: Product performance varies by country, and discontinuing a product globally based on poor performance in one market could be a missed opportunity 
  elsewhere.
